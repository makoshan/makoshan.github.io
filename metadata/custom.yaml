  - <p>The Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR) currently includes data from 61&thinsp;566
    twin pair from 11 provinces or cities in China. Of these, 31&thinsp;705, 15&thinsp;060 and 13
    531 pairs are monozygotic, same-sex dizygotic and opposite-sex dizygotic pairs,
    respectively, determined by opposite sex or intrapair similarity. Since its establishment
    in 2001, the CNTR has provided an important resource for analysing genetic and
    environmental influences on chronic diseases especially cardiovascular diseases.
    Recently, the CNTR has focused on collecting biologic specimens from disease-concordant
    or disease-discordant twin pairs or from twin pairs reared apart. More than 8000
    pairs of these twins have been registered, and blood samples have been collected
    from more than 1500 pairs.</p> <p>In this review, we summarize the main findings from
    univariate and multivariate genetic effects analyses, gene-environment interaction
    studies, omics studies exploring DNA methylation and metabolomic markers associated
    with phenotypes. There remains further scope for CNTR research and data mining.
    The plan for future development of the CNTR is described. The CNTR welcomes worldwide
    collaboration.</p>
