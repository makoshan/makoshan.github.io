  - <p>The Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR) currently includes data from 61&thinsp;566
    twin pair from 11 provinces or cities in China. Of these, 31&thinsp;705, 15&thinsp;060 and 13
    531 pairs are monozygotic, same-sex dizygotic and opposite-sex dizygotic pairs,
    respectively, determined by opposite sex or intrapair similarity. Since its establishment
    in 2001, the CNTR has provided an important resource for analysing genetic and
    environmental influences on chronic diseases especially cardiovascular diseases.
    Recently, the CNTR has focused on collecting biologic specimens from disease-concordant
    or disease-discordant twin pairs or from twin pairs reared apart. More than 8000
    pairs of these twins have been registered, and blood samples have been collected
    from more than 1500 pairs.</p> <p>In this review, we summarize the main findings from
    univariate and multivariate genetic effects analyses, gene-environment interaction
    studies, omics studies exploring DNA methylation and metabolomic markers associated
    with phenotypes. There remains further scope for CNTR research and data mining.
    The plan for future development of the CNTR is described. The CNTR welcomes worldwide
    collaboration.</p>

  - <p>How can we account for the sudden appearance of such dazzling artists and scientists
    as Mozart, Shakespeare, Darwin, or Einstein? How can we define such genius? What
    conditions or personality traits seem to produce exceptionally creative people?
    Is the association between genius and madness really just a myth? These and many
    other questions are brilliantly illuminated in <em>The Origins of Genius</em>.
    </p> <p>Dean Simonton convincingly argues that creativity can best be understood as a
    Darwinian process of variation and selection. The artist or scientist generates
    a wealth of ideas, and then subjects these ideas to aesthetic or scientific judgment,
    selecting only those that have the best chance to survive and reproduce. Indeed,
    the true test of genius is the ability to bequeath an impressive and influential
    body of work to future generations. Simonton draws on the latest research into
    creativity and explores such topics as the personality type of the genius, whether
    genius is genetic or produced by environment and education, the links between
    genius and mental illness (Darwin himself was emotionally and mentally unwell),
    the high incidence of childhood trauma, especially loss of a parent, amongst Nobel
    Prize winners, the importance of unconscious incubation in creative problem-solving,
    and much more.</p> <p>Simonton substantiates his theory by examining and quoting from
    the work of such eminent figures as Henri Poincare, W. H. Auden, Albert Einstein,
    Marie Curie, Charles Darwin, Niels Bohr, and many others. For anyone intrigued
    by the spectacular feats of the human mind, <em>The Origins of Genius</em> offers
    a revolutionary new way of understanding the very nature of creativity.</p>

'<p>[Further discussion of <a href="/notes/Emergenesis">“emergenesis”</a> and relationship to genius: why are geniuses, while sometimes clearly affiliated with entire clans, so sporadic even within those? This is difficult to explain on any environmental or simple additive genetic grounds, suggesting that it may require entire complexes of exactly aligned genes and environmental factors.]</p>
    <p>Human genius has always been a problem for both environmentalists and hereditarians to understand (Galton, 1869; Kroeber, 1944; Simonton, 1988.) There have been families of genius, of course—the Bernoullis and the Baths, the Darwins and the Huxleys, the musical Marsalis family—but it is the solitary genius, rising like a great oak in a forest of scrub and bramble, who challenges our understanding. Carl Friedrich Gauss, ranked with Archimedes and Newton as one of the “princes of mathematics”, had uneducated parents. His mother was illiterate, yet the boy had taught himself to read and to do simple arithmetic by the time he was 3 years old (Buhler, 1981).</p>
    <p>…Suppose that Gauss or Ramanujan had been born with a healthy MZ twin who was spirited away to be reared by some country parson in Oxfordshire. Barring cholera or other accident, is it not likely that the parson’s surname too would now be immortal? Ramanujan died young without offspring; his parents and one brother apparently were unexceptional. Although Gauss provided rich stimulation and opportunity for his six offspring (by two different and highly cultivated wives), none of them distinguished themselves.<sup>2</sup> But if the genius of these men was prefigured in their genes, why was it never manifested elsewhere in their lineage? The answer is, we think, that genius consists of unique configurations of attributes that cannot be transmitted in half helpings.</p>'

  - Traits that are influenced by a configuration, rather than by a simple sum, of
    polymorphic genes may not be seen to be genetic unless one studies monozygotic
    twins (who share all their genes and thus all gene configurations) because such
    have been found to be surprisingly concordant among monozygotic twins separated
    in infancy and reared apart may be emergenic traits. More speculatively, important
    human traits like leadership, genius in its many manifestations, being an effective
    therapist or parent, as well as certain psychopathological syndromes may also
    be emergenic. These ideas reemphasize the importance of the role played in human
    affairs by genetic variation.

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Center_for_Twin_and_Family_Research">Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart</a> [MZA: Bouchard et al 1990, ''The sources
    of human psychological differences: the Minnesota study of twins reared apart''</a>,
    <em>Science</em> 250, 223–228] has demonstrated that MZA pairs are as similar
    in most respects as MZ pairs reared together.</p> <p>Some polygenic traits—eg. stature,
    IQ, harm avoidance, negative emotionality, interest in sports—are polygenic-additive,
    so pairs of relatives resemble one another on the given trait in proportion to
    their genetic similarity.</p> <p>But the existence and the intensity of other important
    psychological traits seem to be  (or
    configurations of independent and partially genetic traits) that interact multiplicatively
    rather than additively. Monozygotic (MZ) twins may be strongly correlated on such
    emergenic traits, while the similarity of dizygotic (DZ) twins, sibs or parent-offspring
    pairs may be much less than half that of MZ pairs. Some emergenic traits, although
    strongly genetic, do not appear to run in families.</p> <p>MISTRA has provided at least
    two examples of traits for which MZA twins are strongly correlated, and DZA pairs
    correlate near zero, while DZ pairs reared together (DZTs) are about half as similar
    as MZTs.</p> <p>These findings suggest that even more traits may be emergenic than those
    already identified. Studies of adoptees reared together (who are perhaps more
    common than twins reared apart) may help to identify traits that are emergenic,
    but that also are influenced by a common rearing environment.</p> <p>[<strong>Keywords</strong>: epistasis,

    (MZA) and data from a larger sample of twins reared together (MZT and DZT), indicate
    a surprisingly strong influence of genetic variation on aptitudes, psychophysiological
    characteristics, personality traits and even dimensions of attitude and interest.
    For some of these variables, MZT and MZA twins show high intra-class correlations
    while DZT twins are no more similar than pairs of unrelated persons.</p> <p>It is suggested
    that such traits are ''emergenic''</a>, ie., that they are determined by the interaction—rather
    than the sum—of genetic influences. Emergenic traits, although perhaps strongly
    genetic, will not tend to run in families and for this reason have been neglected
    by students of behavior genetics.</p> <p>For this and several other listed reasons, wider
