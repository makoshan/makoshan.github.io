<p>The Chinese National Twin Registry (<span class="smallcaps-auto">CNTR</span>) currently includes data from 61 566 twin pair from 11 provinces or cities in China. Of these, 31 705, 15 060 and 13 531 pairs are monozygotic, same-sex dizygotic and opposite-sex dizygotic pairs, respectively, determined by opposite sex or intrapair similarity. Since its establishment in 2001, the <span class="smallcaps-auto">CNTR</span> has provided an important resource for analysing genetic and environmental influences on chronic diseases especially cardiovascular diseases. Recently, the <span class="smallcaps-auto">CNTR</span> has focused on collecting biologic specimens from disease-concordant or disease-discordant twin pairs or from twin pairs reared apart. More than 8000 pairs of these twins have been registered, and blood samples have been collected from more than 1500 pairs.</p>
<p>In this review, we summarize the main findings from univariate and multivariate genetic effects analyses, gene-environment interaction studies, omics studies exploring <span class="smallcaps-auto">DNA</span> methylation and metabolomic markers associated with phenotypes. There remains further scope for <span class="smallcaps-auto">CNTR</span> research and data mining. The plan for future development of the <span class="smallcaps-auto">CNTR</span> is described. The <span class="smallcaps-auto">CNTR</span> welcomes worldwide collaboration.</p>
